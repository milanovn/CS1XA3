Rock Paper Scissors Documentation:
Files "RefinedStrat.elm" and "New_Animations.elm" are file's i've created that my main program - "rps.elm"
imports in order to create modularity and cleaner code.

How the game works:
Choose which action you wish to play by selecting one of the three buttons available -> Choicees are either
"Rock, Paper or Scissors". Once selected, an animation will appear cycling through each and after the cycle
is complete it will display the results. The computer's strategy is not compeletely random so there is
an element of strategy involved. Depending on the outcome, the score will adjust accordingly.

**Note it is possible to have a tie if the same object is chosen by you and the ccomputer.

**Extra Dependecies include
	Graphics SVG
	Elm Random
